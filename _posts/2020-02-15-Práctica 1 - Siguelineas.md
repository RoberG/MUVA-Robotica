## Introduction

The objetive of this practice is to develop an algorithm that is responsible for the automatic piloting of a formula one in a given circuit following a line drawn on the track.
The line is a red line and is located in the center of the track to facilitate the work of detection. In this practice, it will be used image detection techniques and PD controllers
to find a solution that satisfies the problem.
